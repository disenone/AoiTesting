# AoiTesting

简单实现了 AOI 算法中的九宫格算法和十字链表算法，并实测了两者的性能。

Test aoi square algorithm and aoi cross algorithm.

## Build

* 需要 [boost](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_75_0.html)，安装 b2 和 boost。
* 修改 `Jamroot.jam` 中的 `BOOST_ROOT` 变量，改成 boost 安装的目录。
* 在项目目录下执行 `b2`。

* you need [boost](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_75_0.html), build and install b2 and boost.
* edit `BOOST_ROOT` in file `Jamroot.jam` to the install path of boost.
* run `b2` at project directory.

## Result 结果

分别测了玩家加入场景（`Add Player`），计算 AOI 进出事件（`Tick`），玩家更新坐标位置（`Update Pos`）三种情况的时间消耗。结果放在 test_square.txt 和 test_cross.txt 中。

Three situations are tested: `Add Player`, `Tick` and `Update Pos`. Results are placed in test_square.txt and test_cross.txt.
